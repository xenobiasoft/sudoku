# Sudoku API Implementation Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of the Sudoku API implementation and highlights areas that still need to be implemented for a fully functional system.

## Completed

- API controllers structure with all required endpoints
- DTOs for data transfer between layers
- Application service interfaces
- Command and Query handler scaffolding

## Implementation Status by Feature

### Players API

| Endpoint           | Status     | Notes                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| POST /api/players/ | Incomplete | IPlayerApplicationService needs to be implemented |

### Games API

| Endpoint                                          | Status     | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| GET /api/players/{alias}/games                    | Complete   | Basic implementation in place                         |
| GET /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}           | Complete   | Basic implementation in place                         |

| PUT /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}           | Complete   | Basic implementation in place                         |
| DELETE /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}        | Incomplete | DeleteGameCommand handler needs implementation        |
| DELETE /api/players/{alias}/games                 | Incomplete | DeletePlayerGamesCommand handler needs implementation |
| POST /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}/undo     | Incomplete | UndoLastMoveCommand handler needs implementation      |
| POST /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}/reset    | Incomplete | ResetGameCommand handler needs implementation         |
| POST /api/players/{alias}/games/{gameId}/validate | Incomplete | ValidateGameQuery handler needs implementation        |

## Next Steps

### Application Layer

1. **PlayerApplicationService Implementation**

   - Create PlayerApplicationService class implementing IPlayerApplicationService
   - Implement player-related commands and queries
   - Create PlayerDto if needed

2. **Command Handler Implementation**
   - Implement DeleteGameCommandHandler with repository interaction
   - Implement DeletePlayerGamesCommandHandler with repository interaction
   - Implement UndoLastMoveCommandHandler with domain logic for undoing moves
   - Implement ResetGameCommandHandler with domain logic for resetting games
   - Implement ValidateGameQueryHandler with domain logic for validating game state

### Infrastructure Layer

1. **Repository Extensions**
   - Add methods for deleting games
   - Add methods for player management
   - Add methods for game history tracking to support undo functionality

### Domain Layer

1. **Domain Logic Extensions**
   - Add support for undoing moves in the SudokuGame entity
   - Add support for game validation in the SudokuGame entity
   - Add support for game reset in the SudokuGame entity

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for new command and query handlers
   - Add tests for player management functionality
   - Add tests for game validation, reset, and undo functionality

## Conclusion

The API structure is in place, but significant implementation work is still required, particularly in the command and query handlers. The focus should be on implementing the domain logic for the new features (undo, reset, validation) and ensuring proper integration with the repository layer.
