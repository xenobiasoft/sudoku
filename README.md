# Sudoku Game

A modern Sudoku game built with Blazor and C#. Features a clean, interactive UI and multiple difficulty levels.

## About the Project

I created this game to practice TDD, learn Blazor, and to understand some of the algorithms for solving Sudoku. The original game was a Windows Forms application written in Visual Basic.NET and was very procedural and not very testable. I decided to rewrite the game in Blazor and C# to make it more accessible and to learn a new technology.

I refactored the code to be more object-oriented, using some design patterns, and added dependency injection to make it more testable.

Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The game features three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.
